# Rotate 2D Matrix

This project involves rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

## Task

Given an `n x n` 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

### Example

Given the following matrix:

```
[
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```

The rotated matrix should be:

```
[
    [7, 4, 1],
    [8, 5, 2],
    [9, 6, 3]
]
```

## Requirements

- Do not return anything, modify the matrix in-place instead.
- You must do this in-place without using any extra space.

## Usage

To use the function, simply call it with your matrix:

```python
rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)
```
