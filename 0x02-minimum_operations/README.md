# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Description
This project involves solving the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to achieve a specific result. The operations are defined as follows:
1. Copy All
2. Paste

## Task
Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` 'H' characters in the file.

## Example
For `n = 9`, the output should be `6` because the operations would be:
1. Copy All (1 operation)
2. Paste (2 operations)
3. Paste (3 operations)
4. Copy All (4 operations)
5. Paste (5 operations)
6. Paste (6 operations)

## Usage
To use the function, call it with the desired number `n`:
```python
def min_operations(n):
    # Your implementation here
```
