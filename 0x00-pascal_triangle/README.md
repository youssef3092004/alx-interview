## Description

Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept where each number is the sum of the two directly above it. This project aims to implement a function that generates Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.

## Usage

To use the Pascal's Triangle generator, simply call the function with the desired number of rows:

```python
def pascal_triangle(n):
    # Implementation here
    pass

# Example usage
rows = 5
print(pascal_triangle(rows))
```

## Example

For `n = 5`, the output will be:

```
[
     [1],
    [1, 1],
   [1, 2, 1],
  [1, 3, 3, 1],
 [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
]
```
